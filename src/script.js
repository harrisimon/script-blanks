 I'm simply saying that life - - finds a way.

 You can't control anything. I agree with that. I like that. (She walks over to Malcolm, he smiles at her, too warmly.)
ELLIE (cont'd)\n
 You can talk. I don't know how to say it. You're just

 feel. It's exciting.
 MALCOLM\n
 That's right. Will break through.
 ELLIE\n

I couldn’t get the McNabe, Professor. Someone’s got it checked out ‘till next month when classes start.
INDY\n
That’s all right, Phil. Thanks a lot.
TEACHING ASSISTANT\n
(eager to please) Will there be anything else?
INDY\n
No. I’ll see you Thursday. The Teaching Assistant leaves. Brody is scowling as he examines the last of the artifacts.
INDY\n
Hey, if you don’t like them, I can always return them.
BRODY\n
No, they’re beautiful. The Museum will buy them as usual. No questions asked.
INDY\n
Then what’s wrong?
BRODY\n

INDY\n
What kind of people?
BRODY\n
Government.`
